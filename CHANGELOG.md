# Changelog

User-visible changes and compatibility notes are recorded here. Dates and
version headings refer to releases, not merely to merged pull requests.

## Unreleased

### Added

- Security reporting, contribution and agent guidance, issue and pull-request
  templates, code owners, and dependency-update configuration.
- Halt (kiff/kiff-cloud#1061): one tap stops a taf, or every taf with Halt all,
  until you resume it with Face ID. It shows Halted only once tafs' runtime, KIFF
  and planque all confirm, and Halting… until then. Nothing from before a halt
  runs again after a resume. tafs cloud gains `POST`, `GET` and `DELETE` on
  `/v1/tafs/{id}/halt` and `/v1/halt`.
- AI fair use (#193): chats with your tafs and Setup are included up to half
  your plan's monthly price in AI use each period. Past it, your tafs ask before
  going on, and again at each further full bound; AI use is never billed. tafs
  cloud sends the bound with each chat and gains `GET /v1/usage/ai`.
- Task packs: when your tafs' tasks run out, add a pack (Pico, Vonk, Rayo, Forte
  or Maxi) in the app. A pack's tasks last 12 months; your plan's tasks are used
  first each period, then packs, oldest first. Usage shows the tasks the period
  has, what's used and what's left, the packs you hold, and one line on who bills
  your plan, with Manage when Apple does.
- Solo in the app, through the App Store: a monthly subscription that starts
  with a free week, for an account with no plan billed elsewhere. Every offer
  shows its terms. Restore purchases brings back what this Apple account bought.
- Ask an admin: someone who can't add tasks asks for a pack, with a reason, and
  sees it waiting until an admin approves (buys the pack) or declines it with a
  note; they can withdraw it. tafs cloud tells the phones of people who may add
  tasks, and only theirs.

### Removed

- The monthly ceiling row on Usage: tasks past what the plan includes come from
  packs.

### Changed

- A taf's answer only grows as it streams (#206): its words stay as written at
  each tool call, and a call KIFF holds shows its card where the call was made,
  after the words before it, and stays there once answered, in your words
  ("Refused by you · …"). tafs cloud's message stream gains a `held` event with
  KIFF's ids for the call.
- A message you send stays at the top of the chat while the answer arrives
  below it, in a taf's chat and in Coach mode (#206): the chat no longer jumps
  to the end when the answer is short.
