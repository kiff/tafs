# Coach mode

Coach mode is where tafs are made, connected and changed. Its conversation is with
**Coach**, the account's Setup agent: one per account, run by kiff/agents like a taf, but
with no access to the company's business. It shows its work as cards in the chat, asks
planque for each vendor connection, and drafts each taf's Cards in KIFF. The owner reads
and approves each of those on the phone, with Face ID or Touch ID.

Code: in the app, `CoachMode` (the ✦ button, the panel and sheet), `SetupChatView`,
`SetupShapePanel`, `QuestionsCard`, `TrialViews`, `VersionsPanel` in `TafDetailView`, and
the Connections, Setup, Coach mode, Versions and Trying a version sections of `AppModel`;
`SetupComponent` and `SetupShape` for the cards. In tafs cloud,
`runtime/src/cloud/setupdef.ts` (Coach's definition and instructions),
`runtime/src/cloud/coach.ts` (Coach's tools), `runtime/src/cloud/improve.ts`, and
`startSetup`, `versionRoute`, `trialRoute`, `improve`, `mcpRoute` and `runEnded` in
`handler.ts`.

## Opening it

The ✦ button floats on every screen ("✦ Coach mode" on a wide screen, "✦ Coach" on a
phone). On an iPad, Coach mode slides in from the right next to what's open, at a third
of the screen or the width the owner last chose; its left edge drags it wider, up to full
screen. On a phone it's a sheet. Closing never ends a conversation: ✦ reopens it as it
was.

A new conversation is on no taf. Opened from a taf's page, it offers that taf, to
improve with one tap. Starting a new taf is a new Coach conversation.

Who may use Coach is KIFF's answer for the account's Setup agent; by default, an
account admin (`AppModel.mayUseCoach`).

## Starting Coach, once per account

Before the first message, one Face ID (`AppModel.startSetup`):

1. The phone enrolls with planque: planque gets the phone's key, and a KIFF key that
   connects tools and does nothing else, minted with a signed setup call and never kept
   on the phone.
2. The phone submits a KIFF agent draft with no tools for Coach. tafs cloud claims its
   key, so the key never reaches the phone (`POST /v1/setup`).

## What Coach shows

Coach writes messages and shows cards (`SetupComponent.Kind`). A card grants nothing by
itself: an approval names planque's grant and KIFF's draft, which the app reads from
those services, and the phone signs there.

| Card | What it is |
|---|---|
| `steps` | The plan: the work ahead, each step pending, active, done, failed or skipped. It keeps its steps; only their status changes. A step whose call was refused or failed is failed, never done; one the owner declined is skipped; one waiting on the owner stays active. The rules give a read tool the call count its Card line will have, never "no limit" |
| `notice` | Something to know |
| `confirm` | A choice between a few answers |
| `questions` | Several questions at once, every word Coach's. The app adds "Something else…" under each, and "Chat about this" |
| `approval` | A connection or a Card for the owner to approve, with planque's own text and KIFF's draft |
| `sign_in` | The vendor's sign-in page, for a connection the owner approved |
| `result` | The hand-over: a new taf to start, or a taf's new version to try |

The owner's answer to a card is a message, `"[<type> <id>] <answer>"`, one answer per
card.

Coach's chat behaves as a taf's ([chat.md](chat.md)). What starts an answer goes to the top
and stays there: a typed message, or the card the owner just answered. While Coach works,
its work block sits under it, before the first thing the answer records, and folds in
place to "Worked for" when it ends. Each answer lists its own steps, starting again after
a pause, in Coach's words ("Preparing the Card"), never a tool's name. On a wide screen, `SetupShapePanel` beside the conversation shows what Coach has
made so far: the taf's name, the plan, the tools it connects and the Card KIFF drafted.

## Making a taf

Coach asks what the job is, where the work comes from and which systems are involved,
then shows its plan. Then, each step behind the owner's yes:

1. **Connect.** Coach asks planque for a connection to the vendor's MCP server, for the
   taf's own agent. The owner approves planque's grant (one Face ID), signs in on the
   vendor's own page, and the phone confirms the sign-in with the code it brought back.
   planque keeps the vendor's credentials; KIFF lists the connection's tools.
2. **Choose the tools and draft the Card.** Coach picks the tools the job needs and
   submits a KIFF draft of the taf's Cards: what each tool may do, how much each time,
   how much a day. KIFF takes a Card only for a tool that is connected.
3. **Approve the Card.** The owner reads the Card on its approval card and confirms it
   with one Face ID, which signs exactly the draft version shown. An editor's draft
   waits for an admin to confirm it in KIFF.
4. **Start the taf.** The result card hands over the taf. The app asks tafs cloud to
   start it once (`POST /v1/tafs` with `from_setup`): kiff/agents claims the key from
   Coach's draft, and the taf joins the account's list ([tafs.md](tafs.md#starting-a-taf)).
   A start that failed is told to Coach, which shows a new result.

A taf whose tools can't find its work by themselves is made **unscheduled**: it works
from its chat.

## Connections

A taf's connections are on its Card tab (`ConnectionsPanel`): whose keys, which tools,
what happened last. **Disconnect** removes the vendor's tools from KIFF and revokes the
sign-in at the vendor, after Face ID. A connection none of whose tools is on the live
version's Card is shown as left over: the taf doesn't use it now, but an older version
may.

Reading connections asks for no Face ID; it is signed so planque shows them only to the
enrolled phone.

## Improving a taf

**Improve** on a taf (`POST /v1/tafs/{id}/improve`) starts a Coach conversation on that
taf. tafs cloud reads the taf's job, instructions, Cards and latest calls from KIFF with
the owner's own session, and puts them before the owner's first message, so Coach starts
from how the taf is doing (`runtime/src/cloud/improve.ts`).

Coach agrees a change with the owner, then makes it as the taf's **next version**, never
a new taf:

- new instructions, in the owner's words;
- a changed limit, as a KIFF draft revising the taf's own Cards under the same ids;
- a tool it lacks, added to the taf's connection to that vendor, or a new connection;
- a tool that reads the wrong thing, replaced by a fixed one under a new name.

Its result card makes the version (`POST /v1/tafs/{id}/versions`), once per result:
nothing goes live.

## Versions

A taf's versions are on their own screen (`VersionsPanel`), like app builds: newest
first, the live one marked (`GET /v1/tafs/{id}/versions`).

**Install this version** makes one live, forward or back, with one Face ID
(`AppModel.versionCard`). When the version brings a Card revision, it's three steps, so
nothing ever runs with one version's definition under another's Cards:

1. tafs cloud begins the switch (`POST /v1/tafs/{id}/versions/{n}/switch`): from here
   nothing of the taf runs. A run in the way answers 409 naming it; the app can stop it
   first (`stop_blocking`).
2. The owner reads the Card the version brings (`VersionCardSheet`: each Card as it is
   now and as it will be), and the Face ID signs its confirmation in KIFF.
3. The version goes live (`POST /v1/tafs/{id}/versions/{n}/live`).

A switch that stopped half way stays begun, and the next read of the versions ends it
once KIFF has the Card. A switch whose Card isn't confirmed can be dropped
(`DELETE /v1/tafs/{id}/switching`): the live version stays.

## Trying a version

**Try it** opens a trial of a version beside the live taf, under a trial Card of its own
(`TrialStartSheet`, `TrialScreen`). The live version keeps its schedule, Card and budget.

1. tafs cloud prepares the trial Card's draft; the owner reads it, and one Face ID
   confirms it in KIFF as a trial.
2. The trial opens (`PUT /v1/tafs/{id}/trial`). It's a chat with that version, under a
   bar that says it isn't live.
3. It ends on **Install** (the phone confirms the same draft live, then the version goes
   live), on **Go back** (KIFF revokes the trial Cards; the live version stays), or after
   7 days unused. Its chat is then deleted, and the version keeps one line with KIFF's
   counts.

## Coach's own tools

Coach can act on the account's tafs through a small MCP server in tafs cloud
(`POST /v1/mcp`, `runtime/src/cloud/coach.ts`). It reaches it only through KIFF's
gateway: tafs cloud holds no credential for it, and every call carries KIFF's permit,
checked before anything is done (`runtime/src/cloud/permit.ts`). KIFF decides each call
under Coach's Cards first.

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `tafs_state` (read) | Every taf: its live version and versions, a switch under way, its schedule, its open runs and what each waits on |
| `taf_run` (read) | One run of a taf so far |
| `taf_task` | Hands a taf a task or a message: a new run, or to a run at work |
| `run_stop` | Stops a run; its held calls are withdrawn |
| `taf_pause` | Pauses or resumes a taf's schedule |
| `taf_results` | Sets where a taf's results go, all places at once ([doors.md](doors.md#where-results-go)). KIFF holds every change for the owner, who approves it in tafs |
| `version_try` | Tries a version: KIFF decides each of its writes and sends none |
| `version_install` | Installs a version. KIFF holds this for the owner, who approves it in tafs: the app stops what's in the way, confirms the version's Card and makes it live |

Answering a held call is never a tool.

When a run Coach handed a taf pauses or ends, kiff/agents tells tafs cloud
(`POST /v1/runs/ended`). tafs cloud reads the run back from kiff/agents rather than
trust the note, and Coach hears it in its run at work, or at its next turn. kiff/agents
announces only to URLs it is set to allow (`AGENTS_NOTIFY_URLS`), so tafs cloud's public
`/v1/runs/ended` must be among them: when it isn't, kiff/agents refuses the run and
`taf_task` fails with "notify.url is not one this server announces runs to". Moving tafs
cloud to a new URL means updating that list too. The app shows
these as lines in Coach's chat ("coach lines"). While the owner is away, what isn't
urgent waits there as one "While you were away" message instead of a notification
([approvals.md](approvals.md#notifications)).
